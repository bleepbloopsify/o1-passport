# o1 passport

a smart contract testbed that allows for individuals to match against a single, deployed value on chain.

a sample test run looks something like this:

```
o1-passport â™ž  bun run ./index.ts

Note that `Provable.log` is called twice, each time we attempt to `prove` the transaction.


## Commentary on the process

Mina has a global `transaction` object, that prevents us from creating multiple promises and attempting to prove in parallel.

Holy package size batman, 27mb? What is that, a house? (for ref, usual npm packages are kbs)

---

Need to use decorators?;
```
"experimentalDecorators": true, // needed for decorators
"emitDecoratorMetadata": true, // needed for decorators
"preserveSymlinks": true,
```
My tsconfig was hilariously upset, and I don't see docs anywhere for this.

I basically copied this out of the o1js repository.

---

Lack of documentation

I'm very surprised we don't have a `Quickstart` or something for experienced developers to just hot-drop in. Seems like an easy barrier to entry to cross.

---

Same vein, why is the first-scroll on our github repo so enourmous? I see that we're attempting to move scripts in, so thats at least a good start :p

---

I wasn't sure if I could use a dictionary or an array in my `Field` objects, so I just used a single Uint64. There should be a reference for this somewhere, right?

---

Damn this verification takes a while, 10 seconds for a single comparison?

---

Also, how am I supposed to use `Field` outside of `transaction`? I wanted to return the boolean into js-land, but Ocaml seemed _quite_ unhappy with the whole ordeal.

---

```
const allowed = this.allowed.get();
this.allowed.requireEquals(allowed);
```
This feels like the API has a footgun built into it, we probably want an implicit proof here
